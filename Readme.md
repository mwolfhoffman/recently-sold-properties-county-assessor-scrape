# Recently Sold Properties - Salt Lake County 

These python scripts use asyncio, beautifulsoup, and selenium to obtain the homeowners of all recently sold homes in Salt Lake County via the county assessor website.

These scripts can be easily customized for other counties. 

I wrote this scraper because I was curious how scammers and home-warranty companies get access to this data.

## Requirments
1. Python3
1. pip3

## To run: 
1. `python3 -m venv venv`
1. `python3 -m venv/bin/activate`
